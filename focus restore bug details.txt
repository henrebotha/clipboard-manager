FOCUS RESTORE BUG

Using ClipX as a comparison, I've found it's impossible to paste into the search bar in the middle of a new Chrome tab. It should paste into the address bar instead. I'm successfully gaining focus of the address bar, but no pasting.

ClipX will paste successfully into Sublime, but mine will not. Focus is restoring properly (including if I have "find in page" open in Sublime) but it's not pasting.

I thought it might help to attach my thread to Sublime's, but I'm still getting "The parameter is incorrect" when I try to attach threads.
