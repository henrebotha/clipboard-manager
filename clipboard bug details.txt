CLIPBOARD BUG:

Some possibilities.

1. The tkinter main loop ceases to update while minimised.

This code seems to prove otherwise:

    from tkinter import *

    root = Tk()
    spin_count = 0

    def spin(spin_count):
        spin_count += 1
        print("#: " + str(spin_count))
        if spin_count % 5 == 0:
            root.after(1, root.iconify())
        root.after(1, spin, spin_count)

    root.after(1, spin, spin_count)
    root.mainloop()

2. The clipboard_get function can only work while not minimised.



3. The update_clipboard code is not functioning as intended.



4. The fact that update_clipboard and hotkey_handler are both being scheduled using root.after may be interfering with the two of them somehow.

    Perhaps refactor both into an encapsulating function, and only schedule that function with root.after. Tried it - didn't work.
